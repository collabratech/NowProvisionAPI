## Configuration Settings ##

‚úçüèº  Some of these settings are defined in appsettings.json files. In the Azure environment, these settings are defined in global variables

 - **MongoConfig:ConnectionString** - The connection string to a MongoDB database where the data is stored.
 - **MongoConfig:DbName** - The name of the database.
 - **JwtConfig:JwtIssuer** - The issuer or issuers (comma-separated, no spaces) that are allowed to call the API. This should be in a URL format, typically the root URL for the service making the call. If the service doesn't have an actual URL, a URL based on the company with the name of the service in it. *NOTE: Default set in appsettings.json.*
 - **JwtConfig:JwtAudience** - The root URL for this API. This should be specific to the environment to help prevent clients from accidentally making calls in the wrong environment. *NOTE: Default set in appsettings.json.*
 - **JwtConfig:JwtKey** - The key or keys (comma-separated, no spaces) used to verify the JWT is issued by the proper authority and hasn't been modified.

## Introduction to the Code ##

The service was built on a separate architecture in 4 different projects: Ordering.Core, Ordering.Infrastructure, Ordering.WebApi and Messages.
